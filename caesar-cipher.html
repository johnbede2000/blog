<h1>Caesar Cipher</h1>
<p>29/10/20</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>A Caesar cipher is an encryption technique. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left (or negative) shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.</p>
<p>&quot;Write a function that takes a string to be encoded and a shift factor and then returns the encoded string. The cipher should retain capitalization; should <em>not</em> shift punctuation; the shift should wrap around the alphabet; and negative numbers should work as well.&quot;</p>
<h2>Maths equation</h2>
<p>We will use the string method <code>charAt()</code> to return an integer representing the character.</p>
<p>To make it easier to think through the maths, let&#39;s assume for now that the code for a = 1, z = 26. I&#39;ll also assume that we&#39;re only dealing with lowercase letters.</p>
<p>The crux of the solution is simply <code>answer = input + shift</code>. If the length of the alphabet is <code>length</code> then this simple equation works as long as <code>(input + shift) &lt;= length &amp;&amp; (input + shift) &gt; 0</code>. Otherwise we get a result that&#39;s outside of the range of letters 1-26.</p>
<p>If <code>(input + shift) &gt; length</code>, the answer is higher than the range of letters. In order to &#39;loop&#39; back to the first number in the range each time we reach the final number, we could e.g. use a <em>while loop</em> which keeps subtracting <code>length</code> for as long as the result is &gt; <code>length</code>.</p>
<p>Or to achieve the same effect we can use the remainder operator <code>%</code>. So the equation becomes <code>answer = (input + shift) % length</code>. This works for any input with any positive shift.</p>
<p>Next we need to take negative shifts into account. The problem is that when <code>(input + shift) &lt;= 0</code> the answer will be <em>below</em> the range of letters 1-26. So we will modify <code>shift</code> before using it in the equation. The changes made will solve this problem of negative shifts without breaking the equation for positive shifts.</p>
<p>Firstly, we only need to know the remainder of <code>shift &#247; length</code> (with negative shifts this in effect repeatedly <em>adds</em> the length value until we&#39;re within one &#39;length&#39; of the range), because we need to &#39;loop&#39; to the <em>final</em> number of the range every time we get as low as 0. It doesn&#39;t take us into positive territory yet though, for that we just need to <code>+ length</code> one final time. </p>
<p>So instead of using <code>shift</code> in the final equation, we will use <code>(shift % 26) + 26</code>. This will ensure that the <code>input + ((shift % 26) + 26)</code> is always a positive number, however large the negative shift used is. Obviously when using this same equation with positive shifts the answer at this point could end up too large, but as described above that&#39;s taken care of by the <code>% 26</code> right at the end of the whole equation.</p>
<p>The final equation for all situations is:</p>
<pre><code class='language-javascript' lang='javascript'>answer = (input + ((shift % length) + length)) % length
</code></pre>
<h2>Removing Assumptions</h2>
<p>We made some assumptions above, which we&#39;ll now remove:</p>
<ol start='' >
<li>We assumed that the <code>code</code> for numbers actually runs from 1-26. In reality the codes lie in a different range. But that&#39;s easy enough to correct by <code>newCode = code - (one less than &quot;the number that &#39;a&#39; actually is&quot;).</code> This would make &#39;a&#39; = 1, then we can use the equation.</li>
<li>We assumed that letters will only be lowercase. Actually they might be uppercase, which we want to retain. In which case we&#39;ll perform <code>code - (one less than &quot;the number that &#39;A&#39; actually is&quot;)</code> instead.</li>

</ol>
<p>As such we solve both of these two assumptions by deciding the number to subtract. The actual codes are 65-90 for A-Z, and 97-122 for a-z. So if the actual <code>code</code> is in A-Z range then the number to subtract is 64, and if the actual <code>code</code> is in the a-z range then the number to subtract is 96.</p>
<h2>Alphabet length</h2>
<p>As we&#39;re only talking about the alphabet used in English, which has 26 letters before looping around, I&#39;ll replace <code>length</code> in the equation with 26 from now on.</p>
<h2>Punctuation</h2>
<p>It will be easy enough to filter out punctuation to retain, by testing the original <code>code</code> value.</p>
<h2>Description of my function</h2>
<p>Split the input string into an array of individual characters, so that we can iterate through the characters to deal with one at a time. We will use the map() method to iterate (this creates a new array which will contain the characters after they&#39;ve been modified by the shift).</p>
<p>The preliminary function <code>prelim</code> converts the string character into a number <code>code</code>. Test if it&#39;s a letter by testing the range for lowercase and uppercase letters. If it&#39;s not a letter then return it unmodified to the mapped array.</p>
<p>If it&#39;s lowercase then subtract one less than &#39;the number that a-z range starts at&#39;, to make <code>newCode</code> where &#39;a&#39; = 1 and &#39;b&#39; = 2 etc. If it&#39;s uppercase then subtract one less than &#39;the number that A-Z starts at&#39;, to make <code>newCode</code> where &#39;A&#39; = 1 and &#39;B&#39; = 2 etc.</p>
<p>Send the <code>newCode</code> to the <code>modify</code> function which performs the maths explained above. After the maths has been performed, the answer is returned to the <code>prelim</code> function where we need to add the appropriate number <em>back</em> again to get to the actual code used for &#39;a&#39; etc., before converting the code to a string.</p>
<p>The preliminary function then returns the shifted string character to the mapped array. Finally we just need to join the mapped array back together and return the encoded string.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<pre><code class='language-javascript' lang='javascript'>function caesar(inputStr, shiftNum) {
    function prelim(char) {
        // test whether char is uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or not a letter
        let code = char.charCodeAt();
        if (code &gt;= 65 &amp;&amp; code &lt;= 90) { // A-Z range
            let newCode = code - 64; // make &#39;A&#39; = 1 for modify function
            return String.fromCharCode(modify(newCode) + 64);
        } else if (code &gt;= 97 &amp;&amp; code &lt;= 122) { // a-z range
            let newCode = code - 96; // make &#39;a&#39; = 1 for modify function
            return String.fromCharCode(modify(newCode) + 96);
        } else { // not a letter
            return char;
        }
    }

    function modify(newCode) { // apply the shift - allows for negative shift and looping
        return (newCode + ((shiftNum % 26) + 26)) % 26;
    }

    return inputStr
        .split(&quot;&quot;)
        .map((char) =&gt; prelim(char))
        .join(&#39;&#39;);
}
